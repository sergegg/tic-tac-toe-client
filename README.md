# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Planning Story
The planning process that I took for my first project was to review all of the
programming languages that we had learend to-date. After outlining all of the
material that I know, I reviewed the requirements for this project. Knowing all
of the facts, I begun planning which process required which language. I knew
where it would be best to use CSS, HTML, jQuert, Javascript, etc. I created a
wirteframe which allowed me to visualize how I would potentially create my site.
Following those steps I begun planning the Development Process Strategy.

## Development Process
The process I took to develop this project was to first work on the HTML section
of my project. I created all of the buttons for the sign-in, sign-up, change-pw,
and the game board HTML work. Afterwards I worked on the steps which were taught
to us in in class to make each of the elements of the website work properly. The
process went app.js --> debugging --> events.js --> debugging --> api.js -->
--> debugging --> ui.js --> debugging.

## Strategy to Solve Problems
My strategy to solve problems were refrerring to old projects I worked on in class.
I also used sources I found through google, *Stack overflow*, *Code Academy*,
*udemy* and others. Another strategy I used to solve problems is reviewing the
steps I used to create the processes to make the program work. While reviewing
the steps I used, I found minor errors such as spelling errors, typos, and
errors of that nature which made the application work.
