# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Planning Story
The planning process that I took for my first project was to review all of the programming languages that we had learend to-date. After outlining all of the material that I know, I reviewed the requirements for this project. Knowing all of the facts, I begun planning which process required which language. I knew where it would be best to use CSS, HTML, jQuert, Javascript, etc. I created a wireframe which allowed me to visualize how I would potentially create my site. Following those steps I begun planning the Development Process Strategy.

## Development Process
The process I took to develop this project was to first work on the HTML section of my project. I created all of the buttons for the sign-in, sign-up, change-pw, and the game board HTML work. Afterwards I worked on the steps which were taught to us in in class to make each of the elements of the website work properly. The process went as following app.js --> debugging --> events.js --> debugging --> api.js --> debugging --> ui.js --> debugging.

## Strategy to Solve Problems
My strategy to solve problems were refrerring to old projects I worked on in class. I also used sources I found through google, *Stack overflow*, *Code Academy*, *udemy* and others. Another strategy I used to solve problems is reviewing the steps I used to create the processes to make the program work. While reviewing the steps I used, I found minor errors such as spelling errors, typos, and errors of that nature which made the application work.

## Unsolved Problems
I still have to figure out the game-tie situation. I also wanted to design the game website styling better, but had issues with it.
